## **Introduction**
MrTechRecruiter (MTR) is a standalone desktop app aimed in helping technology-related company recruiters overlook and administer job positions and applicants applying for various jobs in their companies.

With the advent of technology and related jobs, MTR uses Command-Line Interface (CLI) for quicker and easier typing for regular users while maintaining a exemplary Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**


**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-applicant 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.


### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicantListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Applicant` and `Position` objects residing in the `Model`.


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `MrTechRecruiterParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPositionCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a position).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.
1. While a modification command is happening, a record of the command's message and the original state of the model before the command occurred is recorded in the separate `Memento` class.
1. The abstract class `Command` is then called to return the `Memento` instance (via `Command#getMomento`) of that state of the model and restores the original state of the model.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-position 1")` API call.

**Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-position 1` Command**<br>
<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="2000"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `MrTechRecruiterParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPositionCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `MrTechRecruiterParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPositionCommandParser`, `DeleteApplicantCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.


### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the position book and applicant book data i.e., all `Applicant` and `Position` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePositionList` and `UniqueApplicantList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Position` and `Applicant` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Applicant>` or `ObservableList<Position>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** To avoid cluttering up the Model class diagram, classes like `ReadOnlyPositionBook`, `PositionBook` etc. are not added. However, they have similar relationships and structure as that of `ReadOnlyApplicantBook`, `ApplicantBook` etc.
</div>


### Applicant and Position

The `Applicant` and `Position` classes are the two main entities in MrTechRecruiter.  
`Applicants` each apply to one `Position`; this relationship is described by the `Application` class.
The following class diagram illustrates this:

<img src="images/ApplicantPositionClassDiagram.png" width="750" />

`Applicants` are:

- Uniquely identified by their `Name`, i.e. `UniqueApplicantList` maintains the uniqueness of its members by performing `Name` comparisons.
  - Additionally, `Name` comparisons are performed on a case-insensitive basis.  
    **Rationale**: `John Doe` is likely to be the same person as `john doe` or `JOHN DOE`; thus, case-insensitive `Name` comparison is more user-friendly (as users cannot be expected to be case-correct all the time).
- Indirectly associated to `Position` via `Application`.

`Positions` are:

- Uniquely identified by their `Title`, in a similar fashion to `Applicant`.
  - `Title` comparisons are also case-insensitive, for the same reasons as above.
- Indirectly associated to `Applicant` via `Application`.

The `Application` class:

- Encapsulates the 'job application' relationship between `Applicant` and `Position`.
- The `Position` field **must** exist; i.e. is non-null.
  - If a `Position` is deleted, all `Application`s referencing it, as well as their corresponding `Applicant`s, are deleted as well.


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both applicant book data, position book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `ApplicantBookStorage`, `PositionBookStorage` and also `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

* All commands that modify the `ApplicantBook` or `PositionBook` will keep track of the state of the model before the modification using `memento`. 
* The `memento` captures the existing model and success message from a command and stands by in the event of an `undo` scenario.
* All such commands will have a :heavy_check_mark: symbol beside it. Others will have no symbol displayed beside it.

* Such commands include `add-applicant`, `add-position`, `delete-applicant`, `delete-position`, `edit-applicant`, `edit-position`, and `mark`.

</div>



### Add applicant feature :heavy_check_mark:

The implementation of the add applicant feature is achieved by the `AddApplicantCommand` class. Just like all other
commands in MTR, it extends the Command class. The most important attribute that it has, is the `ApplicantParticulars`
attribute, which contains all the details of the applicant (Name, Phone, Email, Address,
Title of Position being applied to, GithubLink), parsed straight from the user input.

The `AddApplicantCommand#execute(Model model)` method will use guard clauses to check whether there is a duplicate
applicant, and whether the position (that this applicant is applying to) input by the user actually exists in
`PositionBook`. If all parameters are valid, the `ApplicantParticulars` will then be passed to `Model` to add to
`ApplicantBook`, using the `Model#addApplicantWithParticulars()` method.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add applicant feature behaves at each step.
Preconditions: The app is already launched and the appropriate position that the new applicant is applying to already
exist.

Step 1. The user inputs the command `add-applicant n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street,
block 123, #01-01 pos/software engineer github/https://github.com/johndoe`. The app parser will store all the user-input parameters into an
`ApplicantParticulars` object, and return the `AddApplicantCommand` instance.

The following sequence diagram shows the method invocation in this step:

![AddApplicantSequenceDiagram1](images/add-applicant/AddApplicantSequenceDiagram1.png)

Step 2. LogicManager will execute this `AddApplicantCommand` instance. This will invoke the
`Model#addApplicantWithParticulars()` method.

Step 3. Here, we will retrieve the `Position` object from `PositionBook` if the position exists, using the `Title` that the user
input as argument, and create a new `Applicant` instance using the `ApplicantParticulars` and `Position` objects. Then we will add it to the `ApplicantBook`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If any of the guard clauses fail, i.e. the
applicant already exist, or the position does not exist, an appropriate exception will be thrown and the applicant
will not be created.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes the actions taken when LogicManager executes the AddApplicantCommand: <br>
![AddApplicantActivityDiagram1](images/add-applicant/AddApplicantActivityDiagram1.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How and when the new applicant instance is created:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves all the user input as an `ApplicantParticulars` object.
    * Pros: Avoids the unnecessary clutter of passing multiple parameters to multiple method calls.
    * Cons: May have lead to greater coupling among classes.
  

* **Alternative 2:** Each user input parameter (e.g. Name, Address, Title etc.) are passed to multiple method calls.
    * Pros: Will reduce the usage of a new class, thereby reducing coupling.
    * Cons: This could lead to longer method signatures, longer code, and possibly a less OOP approach.
    


### Delete applicant feature :heavy_check_mark:

#### Implementation

The `delete-applicant` feature is achieved by the `DeleteApplicantCommand` class. Just like all other
commands in MTR, it extends the Command class. The only parameter it takes in is the index position of the applicant in the `ApplicantBook`.

The `DeleteApplicantCommand#execute(Model model)` method will use the `Model#getFilteredApplicantList()` to indirectly
check whether the applicant exists by checking the size of the list against the index provided. The applicant to be deleted is then
obtained from the list via the standard `List#get()` and is removed from the model via `Model#deleteApplicant()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete applicant feature behaves at each step.
Preconditions: The app is already launched and there is an applicant existing in MTR.

Step 1: The user inputs the command `delete-applicant 1`. The app parser simply parses the index 1 and returns the `DeleteApplicantCommand` instance.

Step 2: LogicManager executes this `DeleteApplicantCommand` instance, invoking the `Model#deleteApplicant()` method.

Step 3: This then calls the internal method for `ApplicantBook`, `ApplicantBook#removeApplicant()`, which then removes the applicant thereafter.



### Edit applicant feature :heavy_check_mark:

#### Implementation
The implementation of the edit applicant feature uses the `EditApplicantCommand` class. A unique attribute for this 
class is that the user can simply edit any number of fields or attributes to a particular applicant, with at least 1 field being changed.

The `EditApplicantCommand` method takes in an index and description of the target applicant with the help of the `EditApplicantDescriptor` class.
It then checks if the input index is valid by comparing it to the size of the current applicant list in MTR, as well as ensuring it is a positive integer.
It also has guard clauses verifying that the description has a valid `Title` which is a valid position title in the current `positionBook`. A final check is done to check that the applicant
with the new description is not already existing in MTR. Once these criteria are met, the model then updates the target applicant with the new description via the
`Model#setApplicant()` and `Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()` methods. <br>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit applicant feature behaves at each step. <br>
Preconditions: The app is already launched, the target applicant exists.

Step 1. User inputs command `edit-applicant 1 n/Jasmine Doe p/98761432 e/jdoe@example.com`.  The app parser will store 
all the user-input parameters into an `EditApplicantDescriptor` object.

Step 2. LogicManager executes this `EditApplicantCommand` instance, invoking the `EditApplicantDescriptor#createEditedApplicant()` method to create a new `Applicant` to replace the original one.

Step 3. The model then replace the existing applicant with the new one in the `applicantBook` via `Model#setApplicant()` and reflect the updated list in the UI.

The following activity diagram summarizes the actions taken when LogicManager executes the EditApplicantCommand:

![EditApplicantActivityDiagram](images/EditApplicantActivityDiagram.png)



### Mark/update applicant's status feature :heavy_check_mark:

#### Implementation
This feature is achieved using the `MarkApplicantStatusCommand` class.
It is a simple command similar in functionality to the 'Edit applicant' feature, but streamlined for updating application statuses.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** There are currently only 3 states for applicants: `Accepted`, `Rejected` and `Pending`. These are described in the `Applicant.ApplicationStatus` enum.
</div>
  
The `MarkApplicantStatusCommand#execute()` first confirms the existence of the target applicant to be marked using guard clauses.
If the applicant exists, the applicant is updated with the new application status and the model replaces this applicant.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the mark applicant feature. <br>
Preconditions: Applicant exists in MTR and a valid status is specified.

Step 1. User inputs `mark john doe status/rejected`. The app parser stores the target applicant name and new `ApplicationStatus` internally in the `MarkApplicantStatusCommand` as private fields.

Step 2. LogicManager executes this `MarkApplicantStatusCommand` instance, invoking the `Applicant#markAs()` method and `Model#setApplicant()` method, which creates a new applicant and replaces the existing applicant with the created one.

Step 3. In the UI, the applicant should now appear with the updated application status.

The following activity diagram summarizes the actions taken when LogicManager executes the MarkApplicantStatusCommand:

<img src="images/MarkApplicantActivityDiagram.png" width="750" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Integration or separation with the 'Edit Applicant' feature**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate updating of applicant statuses into its own command
    * Pros: More streamlined command for ease of use
      * Our target users are likely to update applicant statuses a with must higher frequency than information like e-mails, addresses etc. Hence, having a dedicated, shorter command streamlines the user workflow.
    * Cons: Additional command increases complexity, harder to maintain.


* **Alternative 2:** Integrate updating of applicant statuses into 'Edit Applicant' command
    * Pros: Fewer commands for user to remember, also easier for developer to maintain.
    * Cons: More troublesome to quickly update applicant statuses.



### Filter applicants feature

#### Implementation

The filter feature is achieved using the functionality of the `FilteredList` class built into JavaFX, which filters its contents based on a specified `Predicate`.  
This `Predicate` is constructed from the filters specified by the user whenever the `filter-applicant` command is called.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** This command is used for filtering applicants by `Position` and `ApplicationStatus` only, not to be confused with `FindApplicantCommand`, which searches by 'Name', and has slightly different matching criteria.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

Given below is a trace of the command's execution. In particular, we first examine the parsing of user input into a `FilterApplicantCommand` object.
The process is described by the following sequence diagram:

<img src="images/FilterApplicantSequenceDiagram0.png" width="950" />

The role of the `FilterApplicantDescriptor` class is to store the details of the parsed filters for the `Model` component's use, when the `FilterApplicantCommand` is subsequently executed.

The execution of the `FilterApplicantCommand` is shown below in a sequence diagram (as a continuation of the diagram above):

<img src="images/FilterApplicantSequenceDiagram1.png" width="1100" />

The `FilterApplicantDescriptorVerifier` class verifies the 
original `FilterApplicantDescriptor` against the `Model`,
to ensure the validity of the filters specified by the user.

The (verified) `FilterApplicantDescriptor` is then passed to a call to `ApplicantMatchesFiltersPredicate#new`, which takes the filters and constructs a `Predicate` that evaluates to true only for an `Applicant` that passes all the filters, i.e. the filtering is performed with a logical `AND`.

The `ApplicantMatchesFilterPredicate` is then passed to a call to `Model#updateApplicantFilteredList()`, where JavaFX's internal `FilteredList` functionality takes over and handles the filtering of the applicant list.

Note: The `FilterApplicantDescriptor` is not marked for deletion when the command finishes execution, as it is used by the command result to display a success message to the user.

#### Rationale for implementation

The `Descriptor` pattern (used similarly in features such as 'Edit Applicant') comes in handy whenever a command accepts a variable number of arguments & unspecified arguments are assumed to be ignored. For instance, the 'Edit Applicant' feature accepts a variable number of fields to be edited, and leaves all unspecified fields unedited.

The filter feature fits such a description, as the user should be able to specify a variable number of filtering criteria, and unspecified criteria should be left out of the filter. Hence, the pattern is implemented here in `FilterApplicantDescriptor`, which is used to construct the `Predicate`. It is also used in `FilterApplicantDescriptorVerifier`, to verify a variable number of filters.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Filtering the applicant list**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Filtering the Applicant list via the FilteredList API** :
    * Pros: Well-defined behaviour when working through the API
    * Cons: More complex filtering operations are harder to achieve, as we are restricted by the operations defined by the API.


* **Alternative 2: Manually manipulating the ApplicantList (e.g. using the Java Stream API)** 
    * Pros: Greater flexibility; do not have to rely on constructing predicates and passing them to FilteredList.
    * Cons: Directly manipulating the internal list breaks the abstraction provided by the FilteredList API, which can cause bugs.


**Aspect: Reusing 'Descriptor' pattern from AB3's 'EditPersonDescriptor'**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Reusing 'Descriptor' pattern**
    * Pros: Well-documented, pre-existing class that can be adapted to suit current usecase; time saved
    * Cons: Less customized solution (e.g a user might wish to specify multiple criteria for a particular filter, or switch to a logical `OR` filter instead, in which case the `Descriptor` pattern is insufficient to fulfill such functionality).


* **Alternative 2: Delegate the responsibility of constructing Predicates to a new class**
    * Pros: Greater customizability in specifying different types of filters
    * Cons: The class needs to be written from the ground up - this will cause greater complexity & take more time. Tests will need to be written from the ground up as well to accommodate the  behaviour of the new class.




### Find applicants feature

#### Implementation

The find feature is achieved using the functionality of the `FilteredList` class built into JavaFX,
which finds all applicants based on a specified name. This name is constructed via the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` class whenever the `find-applicant` command is called.

The `FindApplicantCommand#execute()` method does not have guard clauses to check that the given name is valid. It simply maps via the `FindApplicantCommand#applicantMatchesFilter()`
method to find all applicants matching the given name. A new filtered list is now displayed on the MTR UI. Hence an empty list may be displayed on the UI. <br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** This command is used for finding applicants by their `Name` only, not to be confused with `FilterApplicantCommand`.
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario of the find applicant feature. <br>
Preconditions: Applicant exists in MTR and valid filters provided.

Step 1. User inputs command `find-applicant John`. The app parser stores all information in a new `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` instance.

Step 2. Model executes `FindApplicantCommand#execute()` method, invoking the `Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()` method, mapping all applicants to check if they have the same name.

Step 3. Results of this new filtered list is then passed to the model and is reflected onto the UI.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Finding via name**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separating searching of name from positions and statuses.
    * Pros: Because of the way we implemented, it is much easier to search via name rather than positions or statuses. Also reduces coupling on the `FilterApplicantCommand` class and easier to test.
    * Cons: Might result in slight confusion for users due to 2 similarly-named commands.


* **Alternative 2:** Use the existing `FindCommand` or created `FilterApplicantCommand` and improve the command from there to achieve this functionality.
    * Pros: A singular class to handle all finding/filtering-related commands, making it easier for users.
    * Cons: Very difficult to code since it requires integrating of multiple existing classes, resulting in potentially many bugs and complicated logic.


### Mark/update applicant's status feature :heavy_check_mark:

#### Implementation
This feature is achieved using the `MarkApplicantStatusCommand` class.
It is a simple command similar in functionality to the 'Edit applicant' feature, but streamlined for updating application statuses.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** There are currently only 3 states for applicants: `Accepted`, `Rejected` and `Pending`. These are described in the `Applicant.ApplicationStatus` enum.
</div>

The `MarkApplicantStatusCommand#execute()` first confirms the existence of the target applicant to be marked using guard clauses.
If the applicant exists, the applicant is updated with the new application status and the model replaces this applicant.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the mark applicant feature. <br>
Preconditions: Applicant exists in MTR and valid mark status given.

Step 1. User inputs `mark john doe status/rejected`. The app parser stores the target applicant name and new `ApplicationStatus` internally in the `MarkApplicantStatusCommand` as private fields.

Step 2. LogicManager executes this `MarkApplicantStatusCommand` instance, invoking the `Applicant#markAs()` method and `Model#setApplicant()` method, which creates a new applicant and replaces the existing applicant with the created one.

Step 3. In the UI, the applicant should now appear with the updated application status.

The following activity diagram summarizes the actions taken when LogicManager executes the MarkApplicantStatusCommand:

<img src="images/MarkApplicantActivityDiagram.png" width="750" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Integration or separation with the 'Edit Applicant' feature**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate updating of applicant statuses into its own command
    * Pros: More streamlined command for ease of use
      * Our target user (Tech recruiters) are likely to update applicant statuses a with must higher frequency than information like e-mails, addresses etc. Hence, having a dedicated, shorter command streamlines the user workflow.
    * Cons: Additional command increases complexity, harder to maintain.

* **Alternative 2:** Integrate updating of applicant statuses into 'Edit Applicant' command
    * Pros: Fewer commands for user to remember, also easier for developer to maintain.
    * Cons: More troublesome to quickly update applicant statuses.


### List applicants feature

#### Implementation
The list applicants feature is achieved by the `ListApplicantCommand` class. Unlike most other commands in the MTR, 
it only has 1 action under the `ListApplicantCommand#execute()` method besides creation of the command itself, which is 
`Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()` which updates the UI to show all current applicants in the `ApplicantBook`.

If there are no current applicants in the `ApplicantBook`, the UI should appear empty.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the mark applicant feature. <br>
Preconditions: MTR has started up and is working.

Step 1. User inputs `list-applicant`.

Step 2. LogicManager executes this `ListApplicantCommand` instance, invoking the `Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()`.

Step 3. The UI is updated to show the current list of applicants.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Listing applicants**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate command from the original AB3, but follow a similar style.
    * Pros: Better understanding of underlying code and how everything comes together.
    * Cons: More time-consuming.


* **Alternative 2:** Use existing `list` command in AB3 and adapt for MTR.
    * Pros: Many functions already in place and little modification is required.
    * Cons: Although less code to be added, due to coupling, more things are needed to be changed intricately and carefully (i.e. prone to errors/bugs).



### Add position feature :heavy_check_mark:

#### Implementation
The implementation of the add position feature is achieved by the `AddPositionCommand` class. There are 2 things parsed 
straight from the user input: The position `Title` and the `Description`. A slight difference from the `AddApplicantCommand` 
is that no separate class is used here - the `Position` class simply creates a new instance directly.

The `AddPositionCommand#execute(Model model)` method will use guard clauses to check whether there is a duplicate
position in `PositionBook`. If valid, the new position will then be passed to Model to add to
`PositionBook`, using the `Model#addPosition()` method.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add position feature behaves at each step.
Preconditions: The app is already launched and the position to be added is new to MTR.

Step 1. The user inputs the command `add-position tit/software engineer des/work in a team that builds a facial recognition application`. 
The app parser will store all the user-input parameters into a new `Position` instance.

Step 2. LogicManager executes this `AddPositionCommand` instance, invoking the `Model#addPosition()` method.

Step 3. The UI for `PositionBook` will now contain the new position added.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Adding positions**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have a singular `Position` class to handle all position related methods.
    * Pros: Simplifies coding and testing since everything is parked under 1 class.
    * Cons: Higher coupling for the `Position` class.


* **Alternative 2:** Have a separate class which contains details of various positions like applicants.
    * Pros: Separates details from the actual class.
    * Cons: Unnecessary since positions have few fields and functions, additional class simply increases complexity. Defeats the purpose of the `Position` class.



### Delete position feature :heavy_check_mark:

#### Implementation

The delete position feature is achieved by the `DeletePositionCommand` class, in similar flavour to the `DeleteApplicantCommand`.
The only parameter it takes in is the index position of the position in the `PositionBook`.

The `DeletePositionCommand#execute(Model model)` method will use the `Model#getFilteredPositionList()` to indirectly
check whether the position exists by checking the size of the list against the index provided. The position to be deleted is then
obtained from the list via the standard `List#get()` and is removed from the model via `Model#deletePosition()`.
When a position is deleted, the applicants applying to the position are also deleted. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete position feature behaves at each step.
Preconditions: The app is already launched and there is a position existing in MTR.

Step 1: The user inputs the command `delete-position 1`. The app parser simply parses the index 1 and returns the `DeletePositionCommand` instance.

Step 2: LogicManager executes this `DeletePositionCommand` instance, invoking the `Model#deletePosition()` method.

Step 3: This then calls the internal method for `PositionBook`, `PositionBook#removeApplicant()` and `ApplicantBook#removeApplicantsUnderPosition()`, 
which then removes the position and related applicants.


### Edit position feature :heavy_check_mark:

#### Implementation
The implementation of the edit position feature uses the `EditPositionCommand` class, in similar flavour to the `EditApplicantCommand`. A unique attribute for this
class is that the user can simply edit any number of fields or attributes to a particular applicant, with at least 1 field being changed.

The `EditPositionCommand` method takes in an index and description (including `Title`) of the target position with the help of the `EditPositionDescriptor` class.
It then checks if the input index is valid by comparing it to the size of the current applicant list in MTR, as well as ensuring it is a positive integer.
It also has guard clauses verifying that the description is valid and different from the one in the MTR. Once these criteria are met, 
the model then updates the target position with the new description via the `Model#setPosition()` and `Model#updateFilteredPositionList()` methods.
It also ensures all applicant's positions are updated using the `Model#updateApplicantsWithPosition()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit position feature behaves at each step. <br>
Preconditions: The app is already launched, the target position exists.

Step 1. User inputs command `edit-position 1 tit/Algorithm Engineer des/embed algorithms into the facial recognition application `.  The app parser will store
all the user-input parameters into an `EditPositionDescriptor` object.

Step 2. LogicManager executes this `EditPositionCommand` instance, invoking the `EditPositionDescriptor#createEditedPosition()` method to create a new `Position` to replace the original one.

Step 3. The model then replaces the existing position with the new one in the `PositionBook` via `Model#setPosition()` and reflects the updated list in the UI.

The following activity diagram summarizes the actions taken when LogicManager executes the EditPositionCommand:

![EditPositionActivityDiagram](images/EditPositionActivityDiagram.png)
    

### List positions feature

#### Implementation
The list positions feature is achieved by the `ListPositionCommand` class. Unlike most other commands in the MTR,
it only has 1 action under the `ListPositionCommand#execute` method besides creation of the command itself, which is
`Model#updateFilteredPositionList` which updates the UI to show all current positions in the `PositionBook`.

If there are no current positions in the `PositionBook`, the UI should appear empty.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the mark applicant feature. <br>
Preconditions: MTR has started up and is working.

Step 1. User inputs `list-position`.

Step 2. LogicManager executes this `ListPositionCommand` instance, invoking the `Model#updateFilteredPositionList()`.

Step 3. The UI is updated to show the current list of positions.


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Listing positions**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate command from the original AB3, but follow a similar style.
    * Pros: Better understanding of underlying code and how everything comes together.
    * Cons: More time-consuming.


* **Alternative 2:** Use existing `list` command in AB3 and adapt for MTR.
    * Pros: Many functions already in place and little modification is required.
    * Cons: Due to coupling, requires changing code intricately and carefully (i.e. prone to errors/bugs).



### Rejection Rate feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed rejection rate mechanism is facilitated by `Model` and `Calculator`.
The `Model` component checks if the position exists and accesses it, while `Calculator` calculates the rejection rate (if applicable).
Implements the following functions:
* `ModelManager#hasPositionWithTitle()` â€‰â€”â€‰Checks if a position with a given title exists in the MTR.
* `Calculator#calculateRejectionRate()` â€‰â€”â€‰Calculates the rejection rate of a position based on the number of total applicants and number of rejected applicants for that position.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasPositionWithTitle()` and `Model#calculateRejectionRate()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the rejection rate mechanism works at every step. <br>
Preconditions: Position exists in MTR and there is at least 1 applicant for this position (regardless of status).

Step 1. The user launches the application which is assumed to have some positions and corresponding applicants applying for them in the MTR.

Step 2. The user executes `rate pos/software engineer` command to calculate the rejection rate of Software Engineer in the PositionBook.
The `rate` command calls `Model#hasPositionWithTitle()`, causing the model to check whether `Software Engineer` exists in the database as a Position.

Step 3. If the position exists, it will access the ApplicantBook via `Model#calculateRejectionRate()`, beginning a count of the number of applicants for the position as well as the number of rejected applicants of the same position.

Step 4. After these numbers have been obtained, the `Calculator` class is called and calculates via `Calculator#calculateRejectionRate()`. This resulting floating point number is then the rejection rate of the position.

The following sequence diagram shows the method invocation in this step. <br>
![SeqDiagram](images/rejection-rates/SeqDiagram.png)

Step 5. Any command the user executes next simply refreshes the current state to its original state as shown in step 1.


#### Design considerations:

#### Aspect: How rejection rate executes:

* **Alternative 1** (current choice): Calculate the rejection rate only when needed. No storing required.
    * Pros: Saves a significant amount of space and reduces immutability. Implementation is simple.
    * Cons: A user could want to calculate many rejection rates frequently and hence not storing these values might have performance issues in the long run.
  

* **Alternative 2**: Store all rejection rates with their respective positions in a dictionary.
    * Pros: Accessing the rejection rates of a certain position will only require access to the dictionary and nothing else - limited accessibility.
      Also, accessing a rejection rate will be much quicker.
    * Cons: Potentially a large amount of space required, slowing performance. Also, the dictionary needs to be updated everytime an applicant's status changes or when a position/applicant is added/deleted,
      which could result in many inter-linked implementations for the dictionary, rendering it slow. May be difficult to show change in UI as well with many layers affected.

The following activity diagram summarizes the actions taken when LogicManager executes the RejectionRateCommand:

### Visualize Positions feature

#### Implementation

This feature makes use of JavaFX's built-in `PieChart` component, as well as the `Tooltip` component to display the percentages of each pie chart slice.  
  
The following activity diagram describes the execution flow of the command:

<img src="images/VisualizeActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

Additionally, the following classes are responsible for generating and displaying the pie chart to the user:
- `PositionPieChart`: A JavaFX `PieChart` summarizing a `Position`, and the application statuses of its `Applicants`.
  - Contains logic to process a specified `Position` and a list of `Applicants` into a `PositionPieChart`.
  - Does some additional post-processing like styling, and installing `Tooltips` to display pie chart percentages.
- `PieChartDisplayer`: Takes in a JavaFX `PieChart` and displays it to the user in a new window.
  - The opened window is set to close when it loses focus, via the `setCloseOnLoseFocus()` method.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates this process:

<img src="images/VisualizeSequenceDiagram.png" width="500" />

Note: The `PositionPieChart` is not marked for deletion when the command finishes execution, as it persists for as long as the user keeps the pie chart open.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Displaying of pie chart to user** 

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `PieChartDisplayer` class.
    * Pros: Quick and easy to use, reusable.
    * Cons: Lack of flexibility, limited choice in UI design.


* **Alternative 2:** Full, `UiPart` class with FXML 
    * Pros: Greater customizability, styling options.
    * Cons: More complex, harder to maintain.



### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The [Memento Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern) is used to implement undo feature. The undo functionality is facilitated by `Memento` and `History`. 
Every command keeps a `Memento` which stores the state of `Model` before any modification is done by a command. 
The `Model` keeps track of the `History` which stores a stack of previous modification commands. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `History` will be initialized with an empty command stack, and the `model` keeps track of the `History`.


Step 2. The user executes `delete-applicant 3` command to delete the 3rd applicant in the applicant book. The `delete-applicant` command updates its `Memento` and calls `Model#addToHistory()`, causing the state of the `Model` before the modification to be saved in `History`.


Step 3. The user executes `add-applicant n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new applicant. The `add-applicant` command also updates its `Memento` and calls `Model#addToHistory()`, causing the state of the `Model` before the modification to be saved in `History`.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a modification command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addToHistory()`, so the model state will not be saved into the `History`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the applicant was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#recoverHistory()`, which will pop out the previous command from `History`, and restore the model in the `Memento` of the previous command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the stack in the `History` is empty, then there are no previous model states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#hasHistory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire model.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.


* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete-position`, just save the position and applicants being deleted).
    * Cons: It is time-consuming to ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct. Since there are many interactions between `Position` and `Applicant`, the undo logic could become complicated.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty: Medium to Hard

Our project requires a fair amount of understanding of the code base. Although some commands implemented were based off of AB3, the interactions between the classes that we introduced, `Position` and `Applicant`, introduced additional complexity to our application that needs to be constantly managed. In addition to significant enhancements based on original features, some commands were freshly added in to be in tune with our product, which requires understanding of JavaFX and careful design.
Therefore, we rate the difficulty level of our project as Medium to Hard. 

#### Complexity of having two, interdependent entity types

Compared to AB3, which only has to manage a single entity type (`Person`), our application deals with two entities (`Position` and `Application`) which have dependencies on each other. This complicates even simple CRUD commands (e.g. When we delete a Position, all Applicants to that Position are deleted as well, to avoid Applicants to a non-existing Position). Hence, for each of AB3's original commands that we adapted to our app, we had to perform thorough testing (both automated and manual) to ensure that our additions did not result in any regressions.

Moving forward, as we added new features, we also had to carefully consider & account for how these features interact with both `Position` and `Applicant`. For instance, in the `visualize` command, which displays a pie chart of a specified `Position`, we implemented guard clauses to account for the user attempting to run the command on a `Position` with no `Applicants`. To check for this case, we need to interact with both the `Position` and `Applicant` objects in our application's model, bringing about additional complexity.

### Effort required: 110 - 120%

Many commands are adaptations of the original AB3 code (e.g. `add-applicant`, `delete-applicant`) so not much work was needed to adapt it to what we wanted. However, besides our weekly 
inputs of coding, we had to brainstorm and constantly adapt our code to better fit our user's needs. The challenges faced as mentioned also delayed many features into later weeks, 
requiring more effort to be put into the project. But overall, our product is not strikingly outstanding with fancy UI, "clever" logical code or AI-integrated but rather maintaining
a realistic, simplistic code base for future developers to further improve on.

### Achievements
* Planning and delivery of software engineering projects:
  * Our biggest takeaway from this project were the various processes and workflow used when working as a team in software engineering.

* Technical skills
  * This project gave us the chance to apply the software engineering concepts that we learnt in the classroom in a practical, real-world context. Some of these include (but are not limited to):
    * Software engineering principles such as the Single Responsibility Principle,
    * Software design patterns such as the Command pattern,
    * Code quality guidelines (Use of guard clauses to avoid deep nesting etc.)

* Introduction to JavaFX & building UIs:
  * This project introduced JavaFX, which introduced how Java applications are built to us.
  * UI design is an integral part of modern applications, and this project gave us a chance to dabble in modern programmatic UI design with FXML through building the GUI for our application.
